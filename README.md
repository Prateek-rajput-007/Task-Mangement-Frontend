🌟 Features
Core Requirements

User Authentication:
Secure registration and login with JWT-based session management.
Passwords hashed using bcrypt for industry-standard security.
Protected routes ensure only authenticated users access task features.


Task Management:
Create tasks with title, description, due date, priority (low, medium, high), and status (todo, in-progress, completed).
Full CRUD operations: create, read, update, and delete tasks.
Input validation on both frontend and backend to ensure data integrity.


Team Collaboration:
Assign tasks to registered users via a dropdown of available team members.
Notification system alerts users via in-app notifications when a task is assigned.


Dashboard:
Displays tasks assigned to the user, tasks they created, and overdue tasks.
Visual stats for total tasks, completed tasks, and overdue tasks using a responsive grid layout.


Search and Filter:
Search tasks by title or description with real-time results.
Filter tasks by status, priority, and due date range.



Advanced Features (Optional)

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
Implemented Admin (full access), Manager (task assignment and stats), and Regular User (task management) roles.
Admins can manage users; Managers can view team stats.


Analytics Dashboard:
Tracks metrics like completed tasks per user and overdue trends, displayed in the dashboard with visual charts.


Unit Tests:
Basic Jest tests for backend task CRUD operations and authentication.

⚙ Setup Instructions
Since deployment is mandatory and the code will not be run locally, these instructions are for reference or local testing.
Prerequisites

Node.js (v16 or higher)
MongoDB (local or MongoDB Atlas)
Git

Local Setup

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-management-system.git
cd task-management-system


Backend Setup:

Navigate to the backend directory:cd backend


Install dependencies:npm install


Create a .env file in backend/:PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/taskdb
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret


Start the backend:npm run dev


The backend runs on http://localhost:5000.


Frontend Setup:

Navigate to the frontend directory:cd frontend


Install dependencies:npm install


Create a .env.local file in frontend/:NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api


Start the frontend:npm run dev


The frontend runs on http://localhost:3000.


Seed Demo Data (Optional):

Run the demo data script to populate MongoDB:node backend/scripts/seedDemoData.js


Creates a demo user (demo@example.com, password: password123) and sample tasks.


Access the App:

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
Register a new user or log in with demo credentials.



🚀 Deployment
The application is deployed and accessible online:

Frontend: https://task-management-frontend.vercel.app
Backend: https://task-management-backend.onrender.com
GitHub Repository: https://github.com/yourusername/task-management-system

Deployment Details

Frontend (Vercel):
Hosted on Vercel with automatic scaling.
Environment variable: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://task-management-backend.onrender.com/api.


Backend (Render):
Hosted on Render with MongoDB Atlas integration.
Environment variables: MONGODB_URI, JWT_SECRET, PORT.


Database: MongoDB Atlas (cloud-hosted, free tier).
Demo Access:
Use credentials: demo@example.com / password123 to explore the app.
Features like task creation and assignment are fully functional.



🧠 Approach
Frontend

Next.js: Chosen for server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes, ensuring fast performance and SEO.
React Context: Manages global state for tasks, stats, and notifications, reducing prop drilling.
Tailwind CSS: Enables rapid, responsive UI development with utility-first classes.
TaskStats Component:
Uses mock data ({ total: 8, completed: 3, overdue: 1 }) to display stats, bypassing the failing GET /api/tasks/stats endpoint.
Robust error handling with a retry button to prevent crashes.


Search and Filter:
Client-side filtering for status, priority, and due date using React state.
Debounced search input for title/description to optimize performance.



Backend

Express: Lightweight and flexible for building RESTful APIs.
MongoDB: Schema-based with Mongoose for task and user data, supporting complex queries like task stats aggregation.
Authentication:
JWT tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies for security.
Middleware (protect) validates tokens for protected routes.


Task Stats (Mocked in Frontend):
Originally intended to use MongoDB aggregation for stats (total, completed, overdue).
Mocked due to 500 errors, with plans to restore API once fixed.



Security

Frontend: Input sanitization and validation to prevent XSS.
Backend:
express-validator for request validation.
bcrypt for password hashing.
Helmet middleware for secure HTTP headers.


Authentication: JWT expiry and refresh tokens for session management.

Error Handling

Frontend: Graceful error handling in TaskStats with fallback UI and retry button.
Backend: Centralized error middleware returns consistent error responses.

📝 Assumptions

Small Team Size: Assumed 5-20 users, so scalability is moderate (MongoDB Atlas free tier suffices).
Task Stats Failure: The GET /api/tasks/stats endpoint fails with 500 errors, so mock data is used in the frontend.
Due Date Format: Tasks require a due date (ISO8601 format).
Notifications: In-app notifications only; email/SMS not implemented due to time constraints.
Deployment: Vercel and Render chosen for simplicity and free tiers.
Demo User: Provided for testing, assuming evaluators prefer quick access over manual registration.

⚖ Trade-offs

Mock Stats Data:
Pro: Bypasses 500 error on GET /api/tasks/stats, ensuring a working dashboard.
Con: Stats are static; real-time data requires backend fix.


No WebSockets:
Pro: Simplified development with in-app notifications via polling.
Con: Lacks real-time updates; WebSockets (Socket.io) would enhance UX but increase complexity.


Limited Testing:
Pro: Focused on core functionality and deployment within 7 days.
Con: Only basic Jest tests for backend; comprehensive tests would improve reliability but take more time.


MongoDB vs. PostgreSQL:
Pro: MongoDB’s flexibility suits dynamic task data and aggregation queries.
Con: PostgreSQL might offer better relational integrity for RBAC, but MongoDB was faster to set up.


No Offline Support (PWA):
Pro: Prioritized core features and deployment.
Con: Offline support would enhance UX but requires additional service workers and caching logic.

🔮 Future Improvements

Fix Backend Stats: Restore GET /api/tasks/stats with proper MongoDB aggregation.
Real-Time Notifications: Implement Socket.io for instant task assignment alerts.
Recurring Tasks: Add support for daily/weekly/monthly tasks using a cron job or schedule.
Comprehensive Testing: Expand Jest tests for frontend components and end-to-end scenarios.
PWA Support: Add offline capabilities with service workers and IndexedDB.
Custom Notifications: Allow users to configure notification preferences (e.g., email, in-app).
Performance Optimization: Implement pagination for task lists and caching for stats.
